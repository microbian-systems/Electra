# Product Guidelines: Electra

## Prose Style & Communication
- **Friendly & Conversational:** Documentation and user-facing messages should be approachable, clear, and encouraging. We aim to be a helpful partner in the development process, not a dense academic resource.
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Explain technical concepts in plain language. If a utility simplifies a complex task, the documentation should celebrate that simplicity.

## Brand Identity: "Developer's Best Friend"
- **Helpful & Intuitive:** Our core message emphasizes ease of use, eliminating frustration, and making coding joyful. Electra exists to make the developer's day easier.
- **Supportive Foundation:** We provide the tools that developers reach for instinctively because they "just work" and save time.

## Visual Identity
- **Technical & Dark:** The aesthetic for documentation and branding is terminal-inspired, utilizing dark mode by default with high-quality monospaced fonts. This reinforces our identity as a tool built by and for backend engineers.
- **High Contrast:** Ensure code blocks and key technical details are crisp and easy to read against dark backgrounds.

## Core Values
- **Simplicity over Sophistication:** We value easy-to-understand implementations over "clever" code. Our goal is to keep the library approachable, maintainable, and easy for any developer to audit or debug.
- **Developer-Centricity:** Every decision is weighed against its impact on Developer Experience (DX). If a feature doesn't make a developer's life easier or their code more expressive, it needs a strong justification.

## Evolution & Versioning
- **Communicative Evolution:** We believe in proactive communication. Breaking changes are avoided when possible, but when necessary, they are preceded by clear deprecation warnings and comprehensive migration guides to ensure a smooth transition for our users.
