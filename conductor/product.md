# Aero - The .NET Application Accelerator

## Vision

Aero is your launchpad for production-ready .NET applications. Whether you're building web, mobile, or desktop experiences, Aero eliminates the boilerplate grind so you can focus on what matters—shipping features.

**Stop reinventing the wheel.** Aero delivers battle-tested implementations for all the essentials: authentication, authorization, identity management, JWT tokens, and database setup right out of the box. No more wrestling with configuration files or piecing together fragmented libraries.

**From zero to production in record time.** What typically takes weeks of plumbing work becomes minutes with Aero. Our modular, Clean Architecture approach means you only pull in what you need—but everything you need just works.

Build confidently. Scale fearlessly. Ship faster.
